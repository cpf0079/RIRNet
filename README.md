## Usages
### Testing a single sample
Predicting video quality with our model trained on the KoNViD-1k Dataset (coming later).
```
python ./released/demo.py
```
You will get a quality score ranging from 0-5, and a higher value indicates better percerptual quality.

### Training on VQA databases
Reading mos values from the .csv files:
```
python ./released/get_label.py
```
Processing .mp4 files to frames:
```
python ./released/get_frame.py
```
Training the model with 'label_path' and 'frame_path':
```
python ./released/source.py
```

## Environment
* Python 3.6.5
* Pytorch 1.0.1
* Cuda 9.0 Cudnn 7.1
